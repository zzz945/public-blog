# Resume 2019

## Introduction
My name is Yan and I am a Full-Stack engineer from China with 8 years working experience. I worked in big technology companies like <a href="https://www.didiglobal.com/">Didi</a> and <a href="https://www.vipkid.com/?vk_fromcode=US">Vipkid</a>. In my recent job in Didi, I am titled senior full-stack engineer in charge of a project called "time machine" which is a useful tool(website) for our product managers to analyze user behavior and for our engineers to trace problems. In that project, I am not only the engineer who develops both the frontend and backend, but also the one who designs the user interface. In frontend, I am experienced in vue framework and I believe I will adapt quickly if react is prefered by your team. In backend, I am experienced in nodejs and sql and I am using koa which is a light weight framework to build api. If your team are using different frameworks or techniques, I do not think it is a big deal because I am good at learning new things. Now, I am looking for a job in America and I will appreciate it if you could provide me a opportunity and be my visa sponser.

## Areas of expertise

### User behavior analysis tool
I built a website called 'time machine' to analyze one user's hehavior or a group of users's. For example, using 'time machine' I can easily know what a user see when they open an app and browser the home page and which button they click to navigate through the app. It does great benefit to product manager and engineer. Product manager can use 'time machine' to improve the design of their product and engineers can use 'time machine' to solve bugs that are hard to trace otherwise. In technique and in brief, I upload the data of user's actions of the product(andoid, ios or h5) to the server and then display them on website in a user friendly way. Also, I have made the website a platform which allows any other application of our company to join in. 

### Administration System
I have experiences of many years for building administration system. An administration system is often a big project which contains a lot of modules and requires many engineers to cowork in it. Every module of the project is often indepandent with each other, so we need to pay more attention to make the code of each module as separate as possible. It is easy to say, however, it is hard to do because many engineers work in one project. To solve that problem, we must make regulations about coding and code review is fairly important. Also, in order to improve effiency, I prefer to use third party's systems to solve common problem like account/permission system, configuration system and process management system which will save me a lot of work.
