### Didi
[Didi](https://www.didiglobal.com) is a leading transportation platform in China that owns more than 80% market share. I worked in the department of [Didi Food](https://didi-food.com/en-US/), which is a food ordering and delivery platform. 
I was a full stack web engineer responsible for the development and stability of the CRM (customer relationship management) system, which includes operations management, data visualization tools, and the like. 

### Vipkid
[Vipkid](https://www.vipkid.com/?vk_fromcode=US)  is an online education company. I worked with the [lingobus](https://www.lingobus.com/) project team. Lingobus is an online Chinese-learning platform.
I was a front-end engineer responsible for the software development of lingobus web and mobile products. Due to the team's small size, there were numerous scenarios for cross-departmental communication. Therefore, I learned and gained excellence in communicating with people from different knowledge backgrounds.

### Actions Technology
[Actions technology](http://www.actions-semi.com/en/index.aspx) is an IC design company. I worked in the embedded software department with the android operating system porting project team, responsible for the android Hal layer software development. 
The Hal layer is an adaptation layer between the Linux driver and the android operating system, which is written in C++. Because the Linux driver is written in C language and the android system is written in Java language, I accumulated rich experiences in C/C++, and Java language development. In addition, I gained deeper understanding of Linux driver as well as the android operating system.
