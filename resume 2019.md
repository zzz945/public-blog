# Resume ~ updated in Feburary,2020

## Self Intro
My name is Yan. I have 9 years working experience, within which I have 2 years embeded software developing experience, 2 years frontend developing experience and 2 years full stack developing experience. In recent one year, I am also a project leader. However, I  once lost my direction soon after I graduated and I started learning frontend technique by myself in 2015 and I found a job after one year. Since then I concentrated on frontend and expanded my knowlodge along the way. For example: 

1. Backend technique: I keep learning backend tech and skills in my work, such as sql. I became a fullstack engineer in 2 years.
2. English ability: I insist on reading english articles, reading technical documents and remembering vocabulary every day. Recently, I got 85 scores in TOEFL test.
3. Writing skill: I love to improve my writing skills. For example, I write down experiences and solutions aquired in my work and shared them with my colleages. Then, I collect their feedbacks to find out things I did not express clearly. After that I will think about how to improve it.
4. Communication skill: I would use the oppotunities of meetings to enhance my communication skills. For example, I would try to explain an idea or suggestion in the aspects of the background of the issue, what the problem is, what is the solution and the plan to apply the solution.


I learned focus the hard way and I will definitely focus on web techique. I also hope I could be the leader of a large project or the leader of a whole frontend team in the near future. That is why I keep expanding my knowlodge and skills in effort.

## My job in Didi
I am responsible for needs assessment, solution design and implementation of tool system, which is a subsystem of MIS(management information system) of Didi food, including search engine evaluation tool and micro user behavior analysis tool, etc.

### Didi food time machine project
I spent 70% of my time on this project, so I want to describe it in detail. I will just call the project time machine.

#### Backgound and goals
Two problem that we face as an international product team is:<br>
1. The distance between our product team and the users is so far that the cost fo money and time to know our users well is too high.
2. The difference of culture and language between our product team and the users is so huge that it requires our team members to have high-level ability.

In order to reduce the cost of analyse our user, drawing close the distance between our produce team and our users, we have been developing a user behavior analysis tool called time machine.
1. Time machine could help 『product managers』 to find out user unfriendly aspects of our product, like ux and strategy.
2. Time machine could help 『developer』to trace bad cases and fix bugs by providing the context of the problem. We know that the questions 『developer』most often ask is what the user had done before he ran into the problem.

##### Brief Product Features
1. 

## Areas of expertise

### User behavior analysis tool
I built a website called 'time machine' to analyze one user's hehavior or a group of users's. For example, using 'time machine' I can easily know what a user see when they open an app and browser the home page and which button they click to navigate through the app. It does great benefit to product manager and engineer. Product manager can use 'time machine' to improve the design of their product and engineers can use 'time machine' to solve bugs that are hard to trace otherwise. In technique and in brief, I upload the data of user's actions of the product(andoid, ios or h5) to the server and then display them on website in a user friendly way. Also, I have made the website a platform which allows any other application of our company to join in. 

### Administration System
I have experiences of many years for building administration system. An administration system is often a big project which contains a lot of modules and requires many engineers to cowork in it. Every module of the project is often indepandent with each other, so we need to pay more attention to make the code of each module as separate as possible. It is easy to say, however, it is hard to do because many engineers work in one project. To solve that problem, we must make regulations about coding and code review is fairly important. Also, in order to improve effiency, I prefer to use third party's systems to solve common problem like account/permission system, configuration system and process management system which will save me a lot of work.
